# Testing with VCR

One of the coolest gems I've used thus far is VCR. It made testing on a couple things really easy. I loved it so much I decided to do my first video tutorial on how to implement VCR in a very simple way. The main point was to simply showcase what VCR does and the steps you need to take to configure it in your test suite. I used RSpec, Webmock, & HTTParty with VCR to make a call to a simple API.

**Take a look at it below and let me know what you think!**

I really had a good time putting this together so I think I'll end up doing more of them on a monthly basis, covering a wide array of topics.

### Again feedback and topic suggestions are welcome!
