Blogs and podcasts have been a vital part of the beginning of my programming career. If it wasn't for the experiences I've read about, I probably wouldn't have decided to take this massive leap (and investment) to learn how to program and kick start my career as a programmer. This community has to be one of the most generous insightful communities around. You would be hard pressed to find another community as generous and motivational as the developer community.

## The Why

I not only wanted to start a blog cause I think a lot more people care about my opinion than actually do, but I also wanted to find some way to be apart of the community. So this is why I've chosen to start a blog. I'll be writing about my experiences, projects I'm working on, issues I encounter, and opinions on just about any topic you can think of.

## The Where

Currently, I'm a student at [Bloc]('http://bloc.io') as part of their Software Engineering track. It's a year long school that will teach me back end, front end, computer science, and career skills all from the comfort of my desk chair. I'm getting ready to start my second week in the school, at the time of this writing.

I've written 2 ruby programs so far, and will have completed about 4 more at the end of my first section. Of course, all of those will be featured on this blog so check back so you can see my progress yourself.

## This Developing Story

As I mentioned earlier, there have been an extremely large of amount of content I've consumed surrounding the programming community, and one of the best resources I've found for inspiration, motivation, and understanding of this new life is [This Developing Story]('http://developingstory.netlify.com/'). If you're interested at all in programming, or just want to know more about it, or if you want to make a huge career change, I'd highly encourage you to check it out.

## Thanks

Thanks for checking it out, and I hope to update you regularly. On the home page there's all sorts of ways you can contact me if you have any questions about programming, learning, Bloc (which I highly promote) or if you just want to share some cool stuff.
