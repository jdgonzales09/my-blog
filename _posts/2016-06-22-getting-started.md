One thing that is difficult to wrap your brain around when you start coding, is the vast amount of information for you to learn. Not only that, but the developer community as a whole can be extremely opinionated on what they think a learning path should be. So when you do research, you here 100 different voices telling you 100 different ways to get started. Personally, I was lucky in this decision because I had some great resources to help lead me along the way.

## Just Start

I listen to two very awesome podcasts. One is called [This Developing Story]('http://developingstory.netlify.com') and the other is called [Start Here]('http://dain.io/startherefm/'). Both taught me that where you start, isn’t as important as just starting.

Another valuable podcast was the [Ruby Rogues]('https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues') podcast. They offer some insight into, not only Ruby on Rails, but also the developer community as a whole. If nothing else, you get to hear people, that are where you want to be in a few years, talk and bounce ideas off one another. It’s extremely fascinating.

## Personal Update

At the end of every blog post, I hope to provide a personal update. Just a quick update on my progress at Bloc and maybe some reflections I’ve had over the past week since I’ve posted.

Currently I’m falling into the end of week 3 of the 48 week course. So there’s definitely still a long road ahead of me, but it’s definitely been incredible so far. I’ve definitely had some late nights and really early mornings as I elected to have my mentor chats first thing in the AM. While the pace is fast, it’s fun. With other resources, I’ve felt that my progress would become stagnant, not with Bloc. Every day there are new challenge and things for me to learn. Well, enough on that soap box.

Test Driven Development used to be completely foreign to me, however, now I’m intimately familiar with the process it seems. Testing, writing, passing, refactoring, testing, writing, passing, refactoring… over and over. Syntax and over all structure is something I’m still learning. I’m getting towards the end of my Bloccit project, which I’ll have a case study up for soon, which will be my first full rails application. I say, ‘first full rails application’ cause I don’t really count the tutorials I did that didn’t include testing of some kind. I’ve definitely understood the importance and benefits of the workflow.

Things have clicked as far as understanding the Model View Controller make up of Rails and other object oriented programming languages. It’s funny though, after one tiny thing clicks, a whole new world of stuff that hasn’t clicked yet opens up.

### Currently Ingesting

I figured, it probably be a good idea to talk about how I stay plugged in when I’m not doing Bloc checkpoints.

*While I code* I listen to some great music. I made it a point to find some quality songs to listen to, to keep me awake and pumped up for what I’m doing. Here’s my sound cloud playlist for the week:

*While I’m learning* I like to take as many supplemental materials as possible, just to explain things that I’m currently struggling with, or that I feel needs to be worked on in myself. I found a great video series called “Ruby Programming” on YouTube that is helping me run though some basics of Ruby over and over again.

*While I’m driving*  a long way, as I regularly do, I normally pop in a podcast from one of the aforementioned shows. Lately, I’ve listened to a lot of Ruby Rogues.
