## Life
I grew up in Fort Worth, Texas with the most incredible family. I moved out to Dallas when I was 18 and never left. I started to program when I was a young geek, making websites for friends I played video games with. That peaked my interest but was pushed to the side for more "viable" career choices. Those career choices didn't work out, so I came back to something I should have done all along.

## Hobbies

* Programming (of course)
* Playing Guitar & Piano (don't ask me to sing)
* Playing Video Games (when I can)
* Writing (hence the blog)
* Reading
